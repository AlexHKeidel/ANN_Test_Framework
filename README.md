# Test Framework for Simple Neural Nets (MLP)
A GUI test framework for comparing and contrasting different multi-layered-perceptron architectures. Define your custom experiment settings and test a number of different parameters. Visualise results with training and validation line plots and ranked results at the end of the experiment.

## Installation
Clone the repo and run with your Java IDE of choice (developed in IntelliJ)

## Features
* Multi-threaded neural network training and testing
* Support for many popular activation functions and learning algorithms for neural networks
* Permanent storage of results and options (serialisation)
* Visualisation of training for easy detection of overfitting
* Visualisation of experiment results for comparison of different architectures
